            <h3>Separate Legal Entity</h3>
            <p>A company in the eyes of the law is distinct (separate) from the people who constitute it. It is capable
                of enjoying
                rights is also subject to duties under the law. A company can also own and deal in property and other
                such assets. One
                point to be noted is that the company is not the agent or the trustee of the subscribers, it has its own
                distinct legal
                identity.</p>

            <h3>Limited Liability</h3>
            <p>Since a company has its own legal identity, its members are not liable for its debts. The liability of
                the members of a
                company is limited to the unpaid share of their share value. There are some companies limited by
                guarantee, where the
                liability of each member is determined by such a guaranteed amount.</p>

            <h3>Transferability of Shares</h3>
            <p>The shares held by a shareholder of a company are transferable by nature. So the ownership in a company
                can be
                transferred in accordance with the manner provided in the Articles of Association. In a private company,
                there may be
                some restrictions placed on the transfer of shares. But the right is not taken away completely.</p>
